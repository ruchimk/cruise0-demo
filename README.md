# Cruise0 Modernization Demo

Sample customer walk through for their SPA React modernization project to show how they can log users via social logins, verified emails and save user demographics (country and photo) to the user_metadata.

## Key Features

This demo is meant to demonstrate how Auth0 can support the Cruise0 app modenization on ReactJS (this demo is built using Auth0's SPA SDK)

* It demonstrates how a new customer can sign up, and how an existing customer can sign in with email/password, and a social login (Google).
* Demonstrates how to link accounts with the same email (i.e. database and social accounts for the same user) with Auth0 via our account linking feature
* Will show you how to show errors if the customerâ€™s email address is not verified. 
* Profile page shows profile photo and country flag are displayed without prompting users to input directly (using rules and IP address of current user)
* If the photo and country of the customer are known, make sure this information is passed back to the application and shown after the user authenticates.
